## Delivery Notes

### Terminal Management

Managing multiple terminals efficiently is **Wicked Important**. At the beginning of this training, pick colors for developers to use for each repo they will be working on. For example, for the cookbook code along, choose a green terminal, and for the clinic lab, use white terminal. The consultant should choose a different color for the library code along. Each terminal should have two tabs
- one tab where the developers will be typing
- one tab for the rails server to run

Drawing a diagram on the board using different colored markers to represent the terminal colors is a great idea as well.

[Issue #14](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-single-resource/issues/14) - This issue was opened as a note of the importance of terminal management throughout this sequence.

### Curl Scripts

When it is time for developers to write curl scripts, the following list is very helpful to have on the board for debugging them.

### CRUD Actions

Keeping track of the different CRUD actions we go through is helpful for this sequence and is great for pacing the training. The following diagram could be filled out over time as each step is completed.

### Additional Diagrams

This has been used in `many-to-many` in the past, but it could be here. It's very helpful in illustrating the flow of a Rails API.
